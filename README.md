## Overview of the Project

   Here we created web page to organize and visulize UFO data. table in web page show data as per users requirnments means based on filter.we wanted to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, users would be able to add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.


## Results

The focus of the project is to build a dynamic webpage that allows users to input filter criteria such as date, city, state, country and/or shape and apply it on UFO sightings information displayed as a table. . The following image shows the final web page, before applying any filters:

## Summary 

One main drawback of the webpage is that data for UFO sightings is static resides in data.js file so web page is dynamic but due to static database user gets results based on data stored in data.js file. 

Following improvements can be made to the existing web page:
* Have drop-down list for filter criteria to select or give more than one value as a filter.
* Allow users to select a date range, rather than one specific date only
* Add a clear filter button to clear all filter criteria
