## Summary 

One main drawback of the webpage is that data for UFO sightings is static resides in data.js file so web page is dynamic but due to static database user gets results based on data stored in data.js file. 

Following improvements can be made to the existing web page:
* Have drop-down list for filter criteria to select or give more than one value as a filter.
* Allow users to select a date range, rather than one specific date only
* Add a clear filter button to clear all filter criteria
